{"name":"picture-show2","tagline":"","body":"## Intro\r\n**picture-show** has moved from google code to github!\r\n\r\n**picture-show** is a simple but elegant desktop application to present your photos. It uses full screen resolution, enables different animation effects and has an automatic timer function to advance to the next photo. No pre-rendering is necessary, start the application and you're good to go.\r\n\r\nChoose a folder of pictures, specify the display properties and the picture-show begins. In fullscreen mode the software is keyboard-controlled during a picture show. The mouse pointer interferes with the appeal of a photo presentation and is hidden once a directory has been chosen.\r\n\r\nEnjoy your pictures using picture-show and impress your audience! Try it now! \r\n\r\n## Dependencies\r\n* picture-show 1 is developed using the Qt framework (4.8) with OpenGL support enabled.\r\n* picture-show 2 is developed using the Qt framework (5.1) with OpenGL 2.0 technology \r\n\r\n## News\r\n* new version: beta 2.03 out now for Win x64 and x86!\r\n* picture-show 2 has been released for Windows systems\r\n* picture-show 1 will still be maintained\r\n* Source code is available via Git: click Source above (2 repositories for version 1 and 2)\r\n* You can find Release Notes for both versions in the 'wiki' section now: ReleaseNotes and ReleaseNotes_version2\r\n* Please report bugs at the issue tab by logging in with your github account\r\n* This is a project under development, please consider this before using ;-)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
